    <h3>Coronavirus</h3><hr>
    <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
        Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to 
        moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.<br>
        Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, 
        chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.</p>
        <p>The best way to prevent and slow down transmission of coronavirus is to be well informed 
            about the COVID-19 virus, 
        the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing 
        your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.</p>
